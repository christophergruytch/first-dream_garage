# first-dream_garage
A simple python program where you can add, review, or delete objects, which in this case are cars, into a json file. Can add or remove from a large "car list," or can create "garages" for you to add cars into separate garages.

I am still in the process of creating this project fully, so you can only add, delete, or read cars from the "car_holder.json" file, creating your own "garages" is as of right now unavailable. I am using this project as a way to learn how to manage data in json files.
